## Context
In this section of my freedom project, I created the MVP for my website.  The MVP was a struggle but also felt very rewarding in the end.  I had implemented my skills of html, css, advanced css, bootstrap, and also the tool that i had learned which was A-Frame.  Over the course of this freedom project i learned a lot about not only how to make a website, but the creative possibilites that come with it.  While making my MVP, it opened my eyes to how some things can look on a webpage and inspired me to do some of those myself, so I did.  There was many challenges i had come across while creating it, but in the end i overcame them and found ways to pass them.

### Challenges
Some challenges that i had faced while designing my MVP was especially within CSS and positioning.  It took me forever to try and get my images in the right spot and get them aligned to where i want to be.

For example while making my timeline section of it, it was extremely hard to fit the images in the circle that was made up as a reference. (It wasn't that hard once i figured it out in the end).  I had searched through a ton of websites trying to find ways to resize these images in the right way, because some would fit and some wouldn't.  I then used my inspect tool and realized that all of the images on the website were under the same class.  I renamed the class of the timeline section, and went into the css and adjust the image size to be the exact size for each of them no matter what the image was to fit inside of the circle.

``` css
.img-fluid {
  max-width: 156px;
  height: 156px;
}
```

Another challenge that I had faced was as i was making my cards.  I had a hard time getting them in the right spot that i wanted and spent a lot of time trying to work on that.  Just like previously i was trying to browse examples of the same problem as me but none of them would help me.  Then as i was scrolling i remembered the previous lessons and also how the coding for cards have their width on them.  I used what i was previously taught and applied it to the code and it aligned them how i wanted them too and they looked the way that i wanted them to.  I also used the previous lessons to adjust the images of the cards to the desirable height and width so that they would fit in the row and look proper.

``` css
.card-img-top {
  width: 100%;
  height: 25vw;
  object-fit: cover;
  }
```

[This was the final product for what my website looked like, and it was a lengthy and difficult process but i am proud of the final outcome](https://andrep8376.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/startbootstrap-agency-gh-pages/)

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
This section of freedom project was in steps 5 and 6 as i make the MVP of my website.  I had designed a wireframe initially to test out how i wanted my website to look and i really liked it so i went with that.  I planned out all of the components i wanted to use, the information i was going to use, and then began to code it all out.  I played around with A-Frame and tried to figure out what i wanted on my website, and i thought it was perfect that i would make a 3D model of a camera, and so that is what i did.  It was really informative and useful the time spent not only learning my tool but with bootstrap aswell, and it made my website come alive, becoming what i wanted it to be.  I was able to put my ideas and desires all on the page, and did it the way that i wanted to with no barriers, and so all of the brainstorming for ideas was coming out well.  I liked what i created, and there are still things that i need to do to be able to improve it even further, but i have a very solid base to what it should be like.

## Skills
Throughout this entire Process, i have been able to keep developing my skills with time management and creativity.

### Time management
There was a lot of information that had to be displayed when creating this MVP so it had to be done under a time schedule.  I created one for myself for what i thought would work best, and it really did.  I spent designated time for each section of the MVP, from beginning to end.  It was difficult at times to stay on track, and I would lose focus of what i was doing in the moment, and it would take me much longer to complete my task.  For instance, when I was making my carousel and history section.  My initial plan was to just get down a base code first and then work on my css, but i would get very into it and spend too much time getting down the code and css at the same time, and then i would lose time to complete the rest of the project.  I eventually got a hold of it, and so those experiences helped me with my time management and stick to the plan of what i wanted.

### Creativity
A lot of creativity goes into play when creating a website, and it was really interesting seeing the way mine came through as i was making my MVP.  Some of the coding on my website and the wireframe wasn't exactly the same, due to me creating new ideas as i was going to what i thought looked best and my creative mind coming out to shine.  The creativity led me to make the page even more of what i wanted and im happy that i made the decisions i did.  Initially, there wasn't going to be a history section, and some of the info was not going to be in cards.  As i was making the website, i got ideas for more ways to portray my ideas and information, and that is how i decided to create what i did in the end.  Photography in itself is an incredibly creative heavy passion, and so creating a website about it was definitely a representation of that.

## Next Steps
My next steps for this project is to go beyond my MVP and make the website even better, and i already have some ideas on how im going to do it.
