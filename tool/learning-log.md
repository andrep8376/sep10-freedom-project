# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Aframe**

## 3/4/24

### While learning Aframe the first place i looked was their website about their [introduction.](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
### They recommend using glitch to tinker and so that is what i did, remixing with their starter code.
### When i first saw this i immediately thought just to mess around i wanted to stack a lot of the cylinders on top of each other, and or in a row. and slowly decrease in size as they grew
### [This is what they use so one can replicate their starter code and work on their own.](https://glitch.com/~aframe)
### I kept making the mistake and using the wrong shapes while i was doing it lol, but eventually i got them all right.  I also kept moving the shapes in the wrong directions.

### This is what i came up with originally.  Then as i was making this i had the thought why not make a traffic light out of the same type of thing.
### The only thing i had trouble with for these things was dealing with the positioning trying to get it right.

### This is what i used to make the traffic light idea that was in my head.
### I have learned a lot about shapes and how to use positioning with Aframe and how to view things from different perspective because you can move all around its not just 2D.
### The next thing i will try is to make something photography oriented, maybe a frame or a scenery image something along the lines of that.

### Originally when tinkering with glitch and aframe i had mad spheres stacking up on one another, and so in this one i wanted to incorporate something like that in this part.
### I wanted to create something that resembled nature because my project is about photography.  The first thing that came to my head was a tree.
### I wante to see the ways that i could make a tree out of the shapes to make it look kind of natural and realistic.
### i tried first by stacking cylinders, longer cylinders, on top of each other to make the root.  I changed the position of each one, radius, their height, and color.
### I stacked them pretty high, and then i tried making the leaves and color, so i took more cylinders, but flattened these ones out.  I stacked them going upwards on the root, and changing the radius of each one so that it would progressively get smaller as you would go up.
### it was a bit challenging trying to stack them all together, i would constantly get the positioning messed up but eventually i got the hang of it.
### After i made the tree I wanted to add a little more so I put some tiny rocks at the bottom of the tree.

### The next thing i plan on trying to learn out of my tool is reshaping the shapes, and creating an even larger scale of nature and scenery that can relate to my project

### In my last learning log i made a tree with some rocks near its roots on the bottom.  I thought of trying out a bigger set of scenery, more trees and more rocks.
### I think i will implement more of the nature as i go and think of more ideas but that is my plan for now.
### I will take some of the same code i used for the trees and move around their positions to create a more realistic view.
### I first started off with the simple tree, and added a bunch of more code of the same so i can get some more trees.
### I then thought of spacing them out but also having them kind of intertwine like it does in real life.
### While trying to space them out i kept getting confused and misplacing everything with the positive and negative positioning, but eventually i got it just right.
### I wanted some to stand out so I added some that didn't have any rocks just to differentiate a little bit.

### The next thing that i want to try for my tool is to create an entirely different landscape with some new ideas that come to mind and what i see around me in my everyday life.
