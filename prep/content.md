## Overview/Introduction/Context
* Context of Photography
* Photography has been around for centuries since the 1800s, invented in France originally, and then widely being spread all throughout the world and growing more and more over time.  Technology wasnâ€™t always used so heavily especially with photographers to start,but what had caused it to become so accepted amongst many and is essentially needed now?  There have been many technological innovations over the span of history, and this site will go over just some of the many that have benefited photography all around.  You find photography being used all over the world in all types of places, homes, museums, stores, video games, and so much more, and technology has further advanced all of the capabilities that these cameras can go too.  It is only up in society as cameras continue to advance, and who knows what the future could have in store for it all.


## Part A: existing technology
* Red Eye Reduction
  * Red eye reduction, a built-in feature in most cameras and hardware that help limit the glare and shine and change of color in somebody or something's eye when flash or light hits it.
  * [This is the effect that Red eye Reduction has on a photo](https://learnopencv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/automatic-red-eye-removal-1.jpg)
* Display Screen
  * The display, used to display information about the camera, all settings possible, exposure, iso, shutter speed, menus, view images, take pictures, and more.
  * [This is an example of what a display looks like on some cameras](https://cdn.fstoppers.com/styles/full/s3/media/2018/11/20/lcd-brightness-camera-07.jpg)
## Part B: possible future technology
* Ultra Low Light Camera
  * This camera would be able to take pictures clearly in nearly pitch black situations.
  * Allowed to change aperture, shutter speed, iso, and more even with light so low like that.
  * Has extremely clear resolution despite being so dark in the room.
* App, allowing one to take a picture on their camera, and automatically transferring to the app and can create any image in a 3D printer type of way of any type of object with much higher resolution and quality.
  * Needs a camera and a phone or computer
  * You can tweak things out in the middle of the 3D printing stage to adjust whatever you want
  * can connect from any location across the globe
