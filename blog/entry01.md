## Choosing a topic

For my project, I have chosen photography as my focus and topic.  I have always been extremely passionate in it since i was young, and found a great love and drive for it.  If i have learned anything about photography, is that technology is surrounded all around it and inside of it.  The functioning of the camera, the lens, menus, settings, every part of the camera contains a large amount of technology in it's own way.  Researching about this project was very interesting, and i learned a lot more than i had previously known.  Adobe, an extremely big company for photograghy, had an article i had read which contained a very large amount of examples of how technology affects photography, and where it is.  [The impact of technology on photography](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/12/01/the-impact-of-technology-on-photography), and [How Digital Technology Has Changed Photography](https://www.dijifi.com/blog/how-digital-technology-has-changed-photography) are two incredible articles from amazing photography sources, having tons of examples and explanations towards how technology has effected photography and how it is found all throughout it.  All of these things fascinate me in many ways, and it keeps me extremely passionate about this topic and to learn more.
