## Content
In this section of my freedom project, I have been taking time learning more about my tool, Aframe.  I have learned the ways to position things, specifc elements and attributes, 3d models, and much more.  In the very beginning i was only making 2d models of designs, and it was interesting the ways positioning worked.  I had never used positioning like that before and so it took a little while to learn.  I would typically have some Aframe docs open just to see if i was doing it right and to see if there was certain things that i was missing.  I eventually would branch off and try and learn more about 3d models, where i made the exterior of an apartment complex.  I had also made a 3d model of a nature site essentially, with trees and rocks.  I took weeks learning more about my tool and practicing with it, tinkering some of the ideas that i had in my head.

These were some examples of the things that i created with Aframe and its code.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
This step of my freedom project were in between steps 4, 5, and 6.  I have still been brainstorming possible ideas for ways to use my tool and to what level it can be used at.  I was using it much more than i previously used it, and i created some of the things that i was thinking about in my head.  It is really amazing the things that you can make with it.  There is still more to learn, but im in my stage of prepping exactly what i want to make for my webpage.  I am practicing more to learn about what i can make for it, but im nearing the time where i am going to decide and plan it all out for what i want.

## Skills
In this portion of the freedom project i developed more of my creativity and my time management skills, much further than before.

### Creativity
Aframe really allows you to push the limits with your creativity and allow the ideas in your brain to flourish.  3d models are much harder and you have to really allow your brain to take over, and that's exactly what i did.  I had some ideas for what i wanted to do, but they came out better than i thought of due to aframe, and also as you are experimenting with it your creativity expands and you want to add more to your project.

### Time Management
While working with my tool, we had learning logs that were due dates to certain steps of our learning and tinkering.  These deadlines and time frames really helped me with time management, deciding when i wanted to use more time or less time, when i needed to.  I took time specifically for each deadline throughout the week and designed some ideas with it, which was very time consuming but that is how it really helped out my time management skills.

## Next Steps
my next step for this freedom project is to decide what i want to do for my website and how exactly i would want to code it.  I will continue to work on my tool and coming to a close to my ideas with it.
