## Context
In this section of my freedom project, I have been taking time learning more about my tool, Aframe.  I have learned the ways to position things, specifc elements and attributes, 3d models, and much more.  In the very beginning i was only making 2d models of designs, and it was interesting the ways positioning worked.  I had never used positioning like that before and so it took a little while to learn.  I would typically have some Aframe docs open just to see if i was doing it right and to see if there was certain things that i was missing.  I eventually would branch off and try and learn more about 3d models, where i made the exterior of an apartment complex.  I had also made a 3d model of a nature site essentially, with trees and rocks.  I took weeks learning more about my tool and practicing with it, tinkering some of the ideas that i had in my head.

These were some examples of the things that i created with Aframe and its code.
