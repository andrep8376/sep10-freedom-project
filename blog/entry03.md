# Entry 3: Content and information set for website
##### 12/22/23

## Content
Through these parts of my project i had further developed my knowledge and information of my topic, while keeping it organized with specific things such as its hardware and software, and also adding more into depth with innovations.  I was able to create some of my own ideas with the technology of cameras and photography and branching off of what i had previously known.  I was organizing my content and information so that it would be ready once needed to put on my website and for public eye, with the information that i had learned and my own ideas.

### These were some of my ideas:

#### Extra Extra low light camera
<ul>
<li>This camera would be able to take pictures clearly in nearly pitch black situations, with no grain and noise</li>
<li>allow to change aperture, shutter speed, iso, and more even with light so low like that</li>
<li>Has extremely clear resolution despite being so dark in the room.</li>
</ul>

#### Ultra zoom lens clear picture
<ul>
<li>at least 3000x zoom with lens, with ultra clear quality.</li>
<li>can capture details of microscopic objects and also very large objects</li>
<li>Can be used for any type of photography, and also within the science and medical fields</li>
</ul>

#### App, allowing one to take a picture on their camera, and automatically transferring to the app and can create any image in a 3D printer type of way of any type of object with much higher resolution and quality.
<ul>
<li>Needs a camera and a phone or computer</li>
<li>You can tweak things out in the middle of the 3D printing stage to adjust whatever you want</li>
<li>can connect from any location across the globe</li>
</ul>

#### Create supersonic speed cameras
<ul>
<li>Camera would be extremely great for outer space, sports, or anything with extreme movement and precise action</li>
<li>Will have features involving aperture, shutter speed, iso, just like normal cameras.</li>
<li>Can capture speeds faster than sound and can take nearly any picture one could imagine</li>
<li>Despite the speed it will be able to take pictures in extremely high resolution and quality.</li>
</ul>

Some of my sources consisted of reviews on [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/adobe-lightroom), website information of apps like [Caputure One Pro](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/capture-one-pro-23-review-a-much-improved-image-editor-with-cool-collaboration-features), and [Adoramas guide to parts of a camera](https://www.adorama.com/alc/parts-of-a-camera/#:~:text=The%20seven%20basic%20parts%20of,to%20capture%20and%20store%20photographs)

## Engineering Design Process(EDP)
For this section of the project i was going through stage 3 of the engineering design process, which is to brainstorm solutions.  I had been gathering more and more information on my topic and starting to create ideas of my own based on the technology that was already present within the world of photography.  More information is released every day about the technology in photography and many can gain various ideas and innovations that could be created over just this technology that is discovered.  With learning and researching i was able to create many ideas for my self of things that could be created as tech advances and grows and that could also be extremely beneficial to society.
