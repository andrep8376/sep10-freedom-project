# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Aframe**

## 3/4/24

### While learning Aframe the first place i looked was their website about their [introduction.](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
### They recommend using glitch to tinker and so that is what i did, remixing with their starter code.
### When i first saw this i immediately thought just to mess around i wanted to stack a lot of the cylinders on top of each other, and or in a row. and slowly decrease in size as they grew
### [This is what they use so one can replicate their starter code and work on their own.](https://glitch.com/~aframe)
### I kept making the mistake and using the wrong shapes while i was doing it lol, but eventually i got them all right.  I also kept moving the shapes in the wrong directions.

### This is what i came up with originally.  Then as i was making this i had the thought why not make a traffic light out of the same type of thing.
### The only thing i had trouble with for these things was dealing with the positioning trying to get it right.

### This is what i used to make the traffic light idea that was in my head.
### I have learned a lot about shapes and how to use positioning with Aframe and how to view things from different perspective because you can move all around its not just 2D.
### The next thing i will try is to make something photography oriented, maybe a frame or a scenery image something along the lines of that.


## 3/11/24

### Originally when tinkering with glitch and aframe i had mad spheres stacking up on one another, and so in this one i wanted to incorporate something like that in this part.
### I wanted to create something that resembled nature because my project is about photography.  The first thing that came to my head was a tree.
### I wante to see the ways that i could make a tree out of the shapes to make it look kind of natural and realistic.
### i tried first by stacking cylinders, longer cylinders, on top of each other to make the root.  I changed the position of each one, radius, their height, and color.
### I stacked them pretty high, and then i tried making the leaves and color, so i took more cylinders, but flattened these ones out.  I stacked them going upwards on the root, and changing the radius of each one so that it would progressively get smaller as you would go up.
### it was a bit challenging trying to stack them all together, i would constantly get the positioning messed up but eventually i got the hang of it.
### After i made the tree I wanted to add a little more so I put some tiny rocks at the bottom of the tree.

### The next thing i plan on trying to learn out of my tool is reshaping the shapes, and creating an even larger scale of nature and scenery that can relate to my project


## 3/18/24

###

### In my last learning log i made a tree with some rocks near its roots on the bottom.  I thought of trying out a bigger set of scenery, more trees and more rocks.
### I think i will implement more of the nature as i go and think of more ideas but that is my plan for now.
### I will take some of the same code i used for the trees and move around their positions to create a more realistic view.
### I first started off with the simple tree, and added a bunch of more code of the same so i can get some more trees.
### I then thought of spacing them out but also having them kind of intertwine like it does in real life.
### While trying to space them out i kept getting confused and misplacing everything with the positive and negative positioning, but eventually i got it just right.
### I wanted some to stand out so I added some that didn't have any rocks just to differentiate a little bit.

### The next thing that i want to try for my tool is to create an entirely different landscape with some new ideas that come to mind and what i see around me in my everyday life.

## 3/25/24

### In this learning log i wanted to make something that reminded me of everyday life, things that i always see.
### I was thinking for a while and brainstorming my ideas, and i came to the conclusion that i wanted to try and make something that had to do with a bulding.
### I see a lot of buildings everywhere, and i wanted to do the simple brick apartment like building.
### My plan was just a large building with a lot of windows and on one side a door.
### A big challenge i had was with changing the colors for the windows.  I kept making mistakes trying to lign them up in the right order and it was not going well.  I finally got the hang of it.
### The positioning aspect of this also was really challenging and takes a lot.  Having to align everything just right and keep up with that many lines of code aswell.
### Eventually after continuing to tinker with it i got the hang of it and was able to create something that wasnt 2d and had sides to it.

### This is what i came up with in the end.  It was very challenging because there was so many blocks and lines of code, 322 to be exact that went into it so changing it was a bit of a hassle.
### I think there would be some things i want to improve with next time like the realisticness and also the windows, but i will continue to learn.
### The next learning log i do and want to try is to make a bigger landscape, maybe a skyline of some sort.

## 4/2/24

### In this learning log i want to branch on to what i was creating last time, and i want to make a skyline with different types of buildings, colors, things of that nature.
### The first thing i was going to to do was recreate the bulding i had from my previous learning log, and then expand horizontally from there.
### I am using New York city as my inspiration, the views you would get of Manhattan from across the water in brooklyn, the skyline is very memorable and so i will use that.
### One thing i struggled on was the positioning of these buildings, making sure they were exactly what i wanted.
### I also struggled with the colors and windows, for some reason those are kind of difficult for me making them be positioned all in the right spots.

### This is what it looked like after i tried to put together something.
### I really hated it, it felt too plain and there was nothing there.  I also got fustrated because of how much i was constantly adjusting numbers.  Hundreds of lines of code of working numbers.
### I think i might try to instead make a detailed inside of a building and see how that turns out.
### I don't know if i am going to do it in this learning log or if i am going to just work on it in the next.
