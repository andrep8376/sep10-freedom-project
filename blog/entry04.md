# Entry 4: Selecting and Tinkering with Tools
##### 2/26/24

## Content
In this step and section of my project, i had researched and viewed different tools to help with web page and css.  Before commiting to one, there was a list of tools provided and i quickly and briefly went through some of them, and had narrowed them down to CSS Variables, AFrame, and CSS flexbox.  I had watched videos on them and read documents on each of them, and AFrames had really stuck out to me for its animations and wide variety.  On a document they give you a starter code to put in that will allow you to use Aframe, and so i took it to JS Bin.  I tinkered around with the code and made an italian flag out of shapes, with changing the positions, height, proportions and colors of the shapes and backgrounds.

This is a snippet/image of the code i used to create the image, and how there is a variety of things that one may do with AFrames, and what i created and put my mind to.  With Aframes starter code, i changed around all of those things to create what i wanted and thought of.

The Document about [Aframes introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) was where i learned about the code and some of the things it was capable of, and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) is where i learned truly what Aframe was and what you could do with it.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

For this part of my project i was in between stages 3 and 4 of the EDP.  I was brainstorming possible solutions, with creating ideas and things that may be revolutionary and extremely interesting for the history and whats to come with photography.  The main part of this section was how i was going to display my information on a web page, and thats where step 4 came in.  I researched about different CSS ideas and designs that would be used on my own page, and i found one that i really liked that had an endless amount of possibilites of what you can do.  This one was even interractive and so people on the webpage viewing it would be able to take a step into my head and move around in it with the ideas that i created and how they might be.
