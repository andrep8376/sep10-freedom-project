## Choosing a topic

For my project, I have chosen photography as my focus and topic.  I have always been extremely passionate in it since i was young, and found a great love and drive for it.  If i have learned anything about photography, is that technology is surrounded all around it and inside of it.  The functioning of the camera, the lens, menus, settings, every part of the camera contains a large amount of technology in it's own way.  Researching about this project was very interesting, and i learned a lot more than i had previously known. [The impact of technology on photography](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/12/01/the-impact-of-technology-on-photography), and [How Digital Technology Has Changed Photography](https://www.dijifi.com/blog/how-digital-technology-has-changed-photography) are two incredible articles from amazing photography sources, having tons of examples and explanations towards how technology has effected photography and how it is found all throughout it.  All of these things fascinate me in many ways, and it keeps me extremely passionate about this topic and to learn more.

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in between steps 1 (defining the problem) and step 2 (researching the problem).  Step 1 had me determining what i wanted to do with this project, what i wanted to find, and what i wanted to solve.  it helped me understand more of what i was passionate about, and grow that ambition.  During step 1, from realizing what was known about the technology in photography, how so many people don't understand how much it is used in it.  Most don't grasp the full concept that all of the a camera and photos have immense amounts of technology, and i feel like that could be a problem for people who are interested in photos, film, photography, and also getting into photography.  Step 2 had me learning more about the amount of technology all throughout photography from start to finish.  For example, when digital cameras hit the scene, technology had already started there and with the resolution of a camera being extremely low and calculations within the lens.  Now, the resolution pixels are much higher then previously, so not only does that show where technology may be located and an example of it, but shows the advancement and amount of it that may be used within a camera and photography.  Step 2 will take some work, and there is plenty more to research, but i am very excited to learn more about it and dig deeper.

## Skills

Some skills that i have picked up when digging into this topic are creativity and time management
