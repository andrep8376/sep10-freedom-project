# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Aframe**

## 3/4/24

### While learning Aframe the first place i looked was their website about their [introduction.](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)
### They recommend using glitch to tinker and so that is what i did, remixing with their starter code.
### When i first saw this i immediately thought just to mess around i wanted to stack a lot of the cylinders on top of each other, and or in a row. and slowly decrease in size as they grew
### [This is what they use so one can replicate their starter code and work on their own.](https://glitch.com/~aframe)
### I kept making the mistake and using the wrong shapes while i was doing it lol, but eventually i got them all right.  I also kept moving the shapes in the wrong directions.

### This is what i came up with originally.  Then as i was making this i had the thought why not make a traffic light out of the same type of thing.
### The only thing i had trouble with for these things was dealing with the positioning trying to get it right.

### This is what i used to make the traffic light idea that was in my head.
### I have learned a lot about shapes and how to use positioning with Aframe and how to view things from different perspective because you can move all around its not just 2D.
### The next thing i will try is to make something photography oriented, maybe a frame or a scenery image something along the lines of that.

### Originally when tinkering with glitch and aframe i had mad spheres stacking up on one another, and so in this one i wanted to incorporate something like that in this part.
### I wanted to create something that resembled nature because my project is about photography.  The first thing that came to my head was a tree.
### I wante to see the ways that i could make a tree out of the shapes to make it look kind of natural and realistic.
### i tried first by stacking cylinders, longer cylinders, on top of each other to make the root.  I changed the position of each one, radius, their height, and color.
### I stacked them pretty high, and then i tried making the leaves and color, so i took more cylinders, but flattened these ones out.  I stacked them going upwards on the root, and changing the radius of each one so that it would progressively get smaller as you would go up.
### it was a bit challenging trying to stack them all together, i would constantly get the positioning messed up but eventually i got the hang of it.
### After i made the tree I wanted to add a little more so I put some tiny rocks at the bottom of the tree.
