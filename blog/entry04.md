# Entry 4: Selecting and Tinkering with Tools
##### 2/26/24

## Content
In this step and section of my project, i had researched and viewed different tools to help with web page and css.  Before commiting to one, there was a list of tools provided and i quickly and briefly went through some of them, and had narrowed them down to CSS Variables, AFrame, and CSS flexbox.  I had watched videos on them and read documents on each of them, and AFrames had really stuck out to me for its animations and wide variety.  On a document they give you a starter code to put in that will allow you to use Aframe, and so i took it to JS Bin.  I tinkered around with the code and made an italian flag out of shapes, with changing the positions, height, proportions and colors of the shapes and backgrounds.

This is a snippet/image of the code i used to create the image, and how there is a variety of things that one may do with AFrames, and what i created and put my mind to.  With Aframes starter code, i changed around all of those things to create what i wanted and thought of.

The Document about [Aframes introduction](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) was where i learned about the code and some of the things it was capable of, and in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) is where i learned truly what Aframe was and what you could do with it.
