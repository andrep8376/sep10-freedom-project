### Content
When researching my topic and trying to dig into the software and hardware of photography, many sites and apps helped provide these ideas and information.  I would look up specifically "the software of photography" which would bring me to many apps that consisted of mainly photo editing types of software, but also much more.  Then i looked up "The hardware of photography" which brought me to long lists of known, and many unknown physical components of a camera and equipement that is used very often for ameature photographers and also veterans.

#### Software
There are many and many apps/softwares that can help further advance photography.  2 softwares that i had came across that were extremely beneficial for photography, and have almost everything you could need are [Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/campaign/pricing.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiA35urBhDCARIsAOU7QwlFmQiXzq_DqQQRjY5X2LYoNmddF8mhZY88qYH_NvGlPsgrRmQ82kkaAqGIEALw_wcB&sdid=KKTJE&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQiA35urBhDCARIsAOU7QwlFmQiXzq_DqQQRjY5X2LYoNmddF8mhZY88qYH_NvGlPsgrRmQ82kkaAqGIEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!677050899114!e!!g!!adobe%20lightroom!1712238382!67643557900&mv=search&gad_source=1), and [Capture One Pro](https://www.captureone.com/en/products/capture-one-pro).  These two softwares are essentially editing apps allowing for near full creativity of your pictures.  Lightroom is listed as one of the most professional photo editing softwares for photographers, giving you full control over how your picture may look and how you want it.  Some specific functions of lightroom is the ability to micromanage major details in all of your photos.  You can mask things in people, backgrounds, and objects all around, reducing noise in your pictures, and much more.  You have full ability in the way your pictures may look and how you would like them to be presented with Lightroom.  With Capture One Pro, you can organize, edit, cull, collaborate, and tether images from within the app from photos that you import.  You can greatly adjust every aspect of your pictures.  These are just two of the thousand great softwares that help contribute to great photography and can significantly impact a picture.

#### Hardware
Cameras are made of a large variety of hardware and parts, and it all can range from little to a lot just with the type of camera you have.  One place I looked was Adorama, one of the most popular photography stores in the world.  I looked at an article they had wrote about the [Parts of a Camera](https://www.adorama.com/alc/parts-of-a-camera/#:~:text=The%20seven%20basic%20parts%20of,to%20capture%20and%20store%20photographs), going in and out.  Some major hardware of a camera consist of its shutter button, viewfinder, flash, display, autofocus, communication ports, and much more.  The shutter button is the actual input and button that you press that captures your picture.  The Viewfinder allows you to view and frame your image to how you would like it.  As technology has progressed over time they have made digital viewfinders, allowing for even more control and HUD to view settings.  The flash is used to light up an area that has extremely low light.  The display with more advanced technological cameras allow for display of information for your picture and also lets you completely control all your settings.  You can adjust and see your exposure, iso, shutter speed, menus, view images, take pictures, and more.  The autofocus features of some cameras allows the system and lens to automatically focus on a target that you want and stay stuck to it.  The communication ports are essential for things such as transfering over pictures, attach equipement to benefit your photography to your camera, mics, etc.  These are just a few of the hardware that consist inside the camera and and there have been many more inventions to the hardware of camera and its technology over time and through history.
