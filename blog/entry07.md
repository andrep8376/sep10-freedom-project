## Content

In this section of my freedom project,  I finalized my website!  There was a lot of hard work and dedication that went into this project, but ultimately extremely rewarding.  I spent a great deal of time actually designing my website, but even longer gathering all my knowledge and research.  This was a year long process, but one that was extremely worth it.  In the process of designing this project, i had done a lot of research on how to get my code exactly how i wanted it, using feedback from peers, teachers, and mainly website i found to help with the code i needed.  This helped me learn a lot not just about coding but deeper than just that, managing my time, trusting in people, taking feedback, working on creativity skills, and so much more.  

### Some takeaways

Once my project was finished and presentations started i learned a lot from that too.  The class presentation helped me with confidence in my project presenting it, and it helped with the class being quiet.  I had to deal with all of the thoughts in my head and no noise to distract it, so it helped with my presentation skills.  I stayed confident and trusted in my work, and i benefited from it.  Mr Muellers feedback showed that aswell as i got a perfect score on my presentation.

At the expo i had learned a lot aswell.  I endured the length of it, having to present for such a long time and it really helped with my skills.  Throughout each set of people that would come by, i would check for the things that i said and tweak anything i didn't like.  By the time the judges got around to me i had felt very confident presenting and had made some minor adjustments to the things that i had wanted to say.  Having to present to so many students beforehand had definitely helped me in my presentation skills, and i feel very good where i am at now.  I even have been selected as a finalist for the SEP showcase, so i will continue developing my presentation skills and the things that i need to do for it.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

The step of this part of my project was the final one, communicating my results.  I had done all of the research, studied it, created a website about it, put my own ideas and findings, and that step had been finished.  Once i was done with that i had transitioned into the communication phase, which was my class presentation and the SEP Expo.  I took what i had learned and took what i had created, and shared it to people.  The first was my class, the people i was doing this project with who did their own.  I presented what i had made and talked about its purpose.  I learned a lot more by doing that presentation, and it helped me with the skill of presenting without looking at my information and just speaking from what i knew.  The Expo presentation helped me even more with it as i was constantly presented for 2 periods.  I had many people come to my table that i was presenting at, and i had shared the same as i did in class, but this time in under a minute to them.  I had to do this many times.  Overall, it helped me greatly and i learned a lot from it.

## Skills

Just like the rest of my Freedom Project, through this process i developed my creativity and time management skills.

### Time Management

This skill was a big one with this project, especially in presenting.  When presenting there is a time stamp that you have to follow, and both the in class and Expo had different time stamps.  I had created a slide show for the in class presentation, and there was a time limit that i had to follow.  I was able to go in depth and get it all done.  A major one was the Expo helping me.  I had to present my project in under a minute which was extremely hard.  I jotted down some ideas i had for what i wanted to say, and timed myself to see if could get it done in under a minute.  I had to really use my time wisely and efficiently, and in the end I did just that.  I figured out how to go in depth, make it feel relatable, and also explain my project in the right amount of time.

### Creativity

There was a lot of things that i could have said with my slides and also elevator pitch so i tried to make it as creative as possible.  I used some of my personal ideas, the things that i learned, and real life examples to really guide me through the presentations.  My website in itself was extremely creative and helped open my mind and that aslso translated into my presentations aswell.  I figured out how to make it connect to people and keep them engaged.  I used my creativity for that and it helped with the grades i was recieving and my overall purpose with presenting.
